"Reason is always a kind of brute force; those who appeal to the head rather than the heart,
however pallid and polite, are necessarily men of violence. we speak of "touching" a man's heart,
but we can do nothing to his head but hit it."

Twelve Types(1903) Charles II
GK Chesterton


"A dead thing can go with the stream, but only a living thing can go against it."
