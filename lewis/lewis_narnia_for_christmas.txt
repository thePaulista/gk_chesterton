“It isn't Narnia, you know," sobbed Lucy. "It's you.
We shan't meet you there. And how can we live,
never meeting you?"
"But you shall meet me, dear one," said Aslan.
"Are -are you there too, Sir?" said Edmund.
"I am," said Aslan. "But there I have another name.
You must learn to know me by that name. This was the
very reason why you were brought to Narnia, that by
knowing me here for a little, you may know me better there.”
